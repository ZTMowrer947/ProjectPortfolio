# ProjectPortfolio
Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Unit 6 Project

## Project Description
This project is concerned with creating a portfolio to show off the five previous projects of the Techdegree.

## Downloading and Running
Clone the repository and run npm's start script in the resulting directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/ZTMowrer947/ProjectPortfolio
cd ProjectPortfolio
npm start
```

This will run the app in production mode, where the app doesn't restart on changes and the stack traces of errors are hidden (for security reasons).

This app app can also be run in development mode, and upon changing code in the backend, the app will automatically restart to apply the changes.

Running the app in development mode is done by following the above instructions, but replacing `npm start` with `npm run start:dev`.

Once you have the app running, it will tell you on which port it is running on. Simply go to `localhost:<port>` in your browser, replacing `<port>` with the provided port number.

## Technologies used
