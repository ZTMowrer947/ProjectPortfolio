# project-portfolio

This project contains the source code for my own portfolio website.

## Technologies used

The portfolio site was built using Next.js and React, along with the Bootstrap styling framework and deployed to Firebase.

TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier were also employed to maintain code quality, along with unit tests written using Jest.
